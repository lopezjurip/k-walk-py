# k-walk-py
Markov chain theory applied on finding most frequently visited edges from random walks. Based on paper *Relevant subgraph extraction from random
walks in a graph (2006)* from P. Dupont, J. Callut, G. Dooms, J.-N. Monette and Y. Deville.

# Instructions

* Modify `main.py` and create your nodes (`V`), edges (`E`) and points of interest (`K`). 
* Create an instance of `Graph` with those parameters.
* Query `N_star` functi√≥n with a starting point of interest.
* Print the resulting matrix to see how frecuently is visited each node.
